# Prescriptive Analytics

Provide a recommendation (“prescription”) on what actions to take to achieve some objective goal.
   - Defining a problem
   - Objectives and Goals
   - Optimization 
   
A problem we would like to solve will typically have a set of goals we want to achieve, a set of  
actions we can take to achieve this goal and a model which describes how the actions impact the goal.

###### Example

Maximize Quantity

We can see from the graph the maximum quantity was sold at the lowest price of 1.0.
If we plug in x=0 into the regression equation, we will get a maximum quantity of y=10.13 items

##### Example 

Maximise Revenue

When the price is decreased, the quantity sold is higher, but the revenue for each item sold is lower.
When the price is increased, we make more money for each item sold, but we sell less items.

This is called a Tradeoff  and in most models identifying the tradeoff beforehand helps us understand what we are looking to Solve.

##### Example 

Maximising Profit

Pricing too low yields negative profit, there is a minimum amount of revenue that needs to be generated us to start making  a profit.
The optimal price is higher than the case for the revenue, it is now 6.5 instead of 5.5.
