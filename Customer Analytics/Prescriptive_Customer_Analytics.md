# Prescriptive Analytics

Provide a recommendation (“prescription”) on what actions to take to achieve some objective goal.
   - Defining a problem
   - Objectives and Goals
   - Optimization 
   
A problem we would like to solve will typically have a set of goals we want to achieve, a set of  
actions we can take to achieve this goal and a model which describes how the actions impact the goal.

###### Example

Maximize Quantity

We can see from the graph the maximum quantity was sold at the lowest price of 1.0.
If we plug in x=0 into the regression equation, we will get a maximum quantity of y=10.13 items

##### Example 

Maximise Revenue

When the price is decreased, the quantity sold is higher, but the revenue for each item sold is lower.
When the price is increased, we make more money for each item sold, but we sell less items.

This is called a Tradeoff  and in most models identifying the tradeoff beforehand helps us understand what we are looking to Solve.

##### Example 

Maximising Profit

Pricing too low yields negative profit, there is a minimum amount of revenue that needs to be generated us to start making  a profit.
The optimal price is higher than the case for the revenue, it is now 6.5 instead of 5.5.

### MR = MC

In the examples above we saw that one increase in price increases our profit, while the other decreases it.

How far should we increase the price? Until there is no gain in profit of course

How can we find when this happens? We look for the case when the change in revenue equals the change in cost. Their difference will then be zero.

The  change  in  revenue  is  called  “marginal  revenue”  (MR),  and  change in cost is called “marginal cost” (MC).

### Willingness to pay

Willingness to pay is how much (at most)  would a consumer pay for an additional item she buys.

We find it by calculating the area below the demand curve for each additional item (or fraction of an item).
