##### Correlation and Causation
  - Correlation = relationship between two variables
  - Causation  =  one variable producing an effect in another variable
  - Correlation is not Causation
  
##### Causal Inference: Three Requirements
  - Correlation: Evidence of association between X and Y
  - Temporal antecedence: X must occur before Y
  - No third factor driving both: Control of other possible factors
