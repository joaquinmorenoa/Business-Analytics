# Operational Decision Problem: Newsvendor Problem: Matching demand with supply

The fundamental operational problem:

Suppose that you are making operations decisions for a retailer who orders a product from a supplier and sells it to customers.
The ordered product items are received and placed on store shelf.
There is a large customer population.

However, you have to order the product before you see the custome. You get only one chance to order.

You donâ€™t know what the demand is going to be.

What could help? Past demand data.

### The Newsvendor Problem

Its characteristics are:
  - You have an objective (usually maximize profits, minimize costs, improve market share, etc.)
  - You have to make one decision (usually, how much to buy, or plan for)
  - Demand occurs, and profits and costs are realized
