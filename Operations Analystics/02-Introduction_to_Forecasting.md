# Introduction to forecasting

  - Primary Function is to Predict the Future.
  - Dictates the decisions we make today.
  - Forecast demand for products and services
  - Forecast inventory and capacity needs daily
  
### Characteristics of forecasting

  - Point forecasts are usually wrong!
  - A good forecast should be more than a single number

### Modeling Uncertain Future: Probability Distributions

We often do not control purchasing behavior, as a result, we cannot predict future demand with certainty.

##### Example 

Three Scenarios Probability Distribution: Scenarios

### Describing Probability Distribution: Mean and Standard Deviation

For any probability distribution, including a simple one reflecting three demand scenarios, two useful descriptive quantities are often calculated: mean and standard deviation.

### Discrete vs. Continuous Probability Distributions

So far, we have looked at a discrete probability distributions with a number, of future scenarios with an “attached” probability for each scenario.

But what will happen to a discrete probability picture when
  - random variable being modeled has a really large number of scenarios on any small interval of possible interval of values
  - the probability that any one scenario is realized is really small
  
In such cases, it makes sense to describe such probability distribution using groups of scenarios rather than focusing on individual 
scenarios.

### Continuous Distribution: Random Variable X

### Normal Distribution

Allows the underlying random variable to take any value from negative infinity to positive infinity and is completely 
characterized by two parameters 
mean and SD
